## Testing
**Promotion Handling Test Suite**  
**Partitioning the Characteristics**  
| Characteristic    | b1       | b2       | b3       |  
|--------------------|----------|----------|----------|  
| C1 = Promotion ID | Valid    | Expired  | Invalid  |  
| C2 = Cart Items   | None     | Single   | Multiple |  

**Testable Functions**  
**Method**: `fetchPromotions()`  
- **Parameters**: None  
- **Return Type**: `Array` of promotion objects  
- **Return Value**: Successfully retrieves and returns promotion data.  
- **Exceptional Behavior**: Handles API errors or invalid responses gracefully.  

**Interface-Based Characteristics**  
**Combining Partitions to Define Test Requirements (ACOC):**  
| Test Case | Promotion ID | Cart Items | Expected Outcome                                   |  
|-----------|--------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|  
| T1        | Valid        | None       | Promotions are fetched but no discount applied.   |  
| T2        | Valid        | Single     | Promotion is successfully applied.                |  
| T3        | Valid        | Multiple   | Promotion is successfully applied to multiple items. |  
| T4        | Expired      | None       | Promotions are fetched but no discount applied.   |  
| T5        | Expired      | Single     | Promotion is not applied due to expiration.       |  
| T6        | Expired      | Multiple   | Promotion is not applied due to expiration.       |  
| T7        | Invalid      | None       | Promotions are fetched but invalid promotion is ignored. |  
| T8        | Invalid      | Single     | Promotion is ignored as it is invalid.            |  
| T9        | Invalid      | Multiple   | Promotion is ignored as it is invalid.            |  


## CartPage Test Suite
**Interface-Based Characteristics**

| **Test Case** | **Cart Items Present** | **Select Mode** | **Quantity Change Trigger** | **Expected Outcome**                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **T1**        | Empty                  | `false`         | None                        | Total is `0`. No items to display. Quantity buttons are disabled.                  |
| **T2**        | Non-empty              | `false`         | Increase                    | Item quantity is incremented. Total updates accordingly. Select mode UI is inactive. |
| **T3**        | Non-empty              | `true`          | Increase                    | Item quantity is incremented. Select mode UI is active. Total updates accordingly.  |
| **T4**        | Non-empty              | `false`         | Decrease                    | Item quantity is decreased (if greater than 1). Total updates. Select mode UI is inactive. |
| **T5**        | Large cart             | `false`         | Decrease                    | Item quantity is decreased (if greater than 1). Total 


**Combining the Partitions (PWC)**
**By combining these partitions, we create test cases to validate the component's behavior.**

| Test Case | Cart Items Present | Select Mode | Quantity Change Trigger | Expected Outcome |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **T1**    | Empty              | `false`     | None                    | Total is `0`. No items to display. Quantity buttons are disabled. |
| **T2**    | Non-empty          | `false`     | Increase                | Item quantity is incremented. Total updates accordingly. Select mode UI is inactive. |
| **T3**    | Non-empty          | `true`      | Increase                | Item quantity is incremented. Select mode UI is active. Total updates accordingly. |
| **T4**    | Non-empty          | `false`     | Decrease                | Item quantity is decreased (if greater than 1). Total updates. Select mode UI is inactive. |
| **T5**    | Large cart         | `false`     | Decrease                | Item quantity is decreased (if greater than 1). Total updates for a large cart. Select mode UI is inactive. |




### Unit Tests
Unit tests are written in Jest and can be run with:
```bash
npm test
```
Coverage reports will be generated under the `coverage/` directory.

### End-to-End Tests
End-to-end tests are written in the Robot Framework. To execute the tests:
1. Install [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) by following this guideline [How To Install Robot Framework](https://docs.robotframework.org/docs/getting_started/testing)
2. Run:
   ```bash
   robot automated_test_cases
   ```
